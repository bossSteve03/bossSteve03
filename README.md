### Hi there 👋
I'm Steve Totev,

I work as a Junior Software Developer at DEKRA.

I learnt the majority of my fundamentals at a coding bootcamp,

and most recently I completed a Level 3 IT Solutions Technician (Software) apprenticeship.

A lot of my work is spread across GitHub & Azure Repos.

In addition to the statistics below, I also have a lot of experience in PHP and some experience with C#

The massive percent of Javascript is a product of my activity developing with React.
